# Project Detailer

**Your project's memory, powered by AI.**

Project Detailer is a knowledge management tool designed for creators, developers, writers, and teams who need to capture, organize, and retrieve project-specific information effortlessly. Whether you're writing a novel, building software, designing a game, or managing any complex project — Project Detailer helps you store details and query them conversationally.

## 🎯 The Problem

Working on complex projects means juggling countless details:
- *Writers* forget character backstories, world-building rules, or plot points
- *Developers* lose track of feature decisions, architectural choices, or legacy code reasoning
- *Game designers* struggle to recall lore, mechanics, or asset specifications

Traditional documentation gets buried. Wikis become outdated. Notes scatter across tools.

## 💡 The Solution

Project Detailer lets you:

1. **Create projects** — Organize your work into separate, focused spaces
2. **Add details freely** — Use a simple form to capture any information, as brief or detailed as needed
3. **Ask questions naturally** — Chat with your project using AI that *only* knows what you've documented

The AI doesn't hallucinate or make things up. If something isn't in your project data, it tells you — keeping your source of truth reliable.

## 🏗️ How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Add Details   │ ──▶ │   Vector DB     │ ──▶ │   AI Chat       │
│   (Simple Form) │     │   (Storage)     │     │   (Query)       │

```

1. **Create a project** for your book, app, game, or any endeavor
2. **Add details** through a minimal form — describe characters, features, concepts
3. **Chat with your project** — ask questions and get answers based solely on your data
